# GridMaps

This package provides the single, simple GridMap type and some associated methods. The typical use is to create a GridMap using a multi-dimensional array of data and bounds for all the dimensions of the region. Then individual values can be extracted by calling the created type with a desired multi-dimensional point. See below for more details and examples.
