This package provides the single, simple GridMap type. The purpose of this type is to represent a rectangular region of any number of dimensions and allow saving and retrieving data values based on an underlying grid structure. Its main feature is to implicitly handle the calculation between map coordinates and array indices. See the documentation for more details and use.
